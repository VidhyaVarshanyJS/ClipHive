###  If you're unfamiliar with ClipHive, let me say:

Everything I use throughout my workday is stored in this archive. Many helpful pieces of data are compiled here. For me, it has served as a treasure trove of information that I frequently revisit.

### To what end?
Really, it's a must-read for everyone. This place has everything somebody might ever want. To be completely forthright, though, its primary concentration is on streamlining the educational, learning, tool, and content creation processes.

### Vision 
In an effort to benefit as many people as possible, we have catalogued, indexed, and archived as much relevant content as we can find, both for the benefit of present-day users and future generations. The world would be a better place if more people followed our lead and placed others' needs ahead of their own.

### Mission

To make this journey of archiving resources a long lastiing one and to be accessible by anyone


### Guidelines

There are only a few basic guidelines that must be followed for this endeavor:
- Do not spam
- Do not distribute irrelevant or useless information
- Take responsibility for your actions.
